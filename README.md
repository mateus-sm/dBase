# dBase
This project aims to build a dBase like environment in C including its GUI. The main object in doing so is to implement concepts of Data Structure course, so all the operations will be done in memory using dynamic linked lists. 

## Scope
Simulate a system like classic dBase (80's / 90's) manipulating fields, records and data structures files ".DBF" with operations of Create, Read, Update, Delete and more

## List of Functionalities

- `SET DEFAULT TO`: Select a logic Drive (`D:` or `C:`)
- `CREATE`: Create a ".DBF" file (in memory)
- `DIR`: Lists the files created in the current drive
- `USE`: Open a file
- `LIST STRUCTURE`: Show all fields of the file structure 
- `APPEND`: Append new records to the `.DBF` file 
- `LIST`: Lists the records with aditional filters
- `LOCATE`: Search for records based on conditions
- `GOTO`, `DISPLAY`, `EDIT`: Navigate and edit records
- `DELETE`, `RECALL`, `PACK`, `ZAP`: Delete methods
- `CLEAR`, `QUIT`, `SET DELETED ON/OFF`: Aux commands
- `MODIFY STRUCTURE` and `SORT`: Extra


## GUI

The interface is done with a modified version of [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/)(4.7.1 32bit) and [conio2.h](https://conio.sourceforge.net/) the download can be found [here](https://github.com/mateus-sm/Conio2-VsCode).
